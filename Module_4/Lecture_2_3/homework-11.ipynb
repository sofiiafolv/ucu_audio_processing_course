I cannot increase batch-size, as I get CUDA out of memory error. After 400 steps loss decreases really slow, so I guess there is no reason to run more epochs than 100, as the loss is almost the same after 3000 steps. It won't decrease very much, so maybe it won't make any differences, but the time will be wasted.
